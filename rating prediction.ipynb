       " 'For someone who listens to assorted English music all the time on Spotify premium, this new 2021 model is disappointing.\\n\\nI am not saying it’s a bad earphone to buy - the sound clarity is amazing but the bass depth is negligible and the whole set lacks the loudness factor. It had me check the volume button on my iPhone just to be sure!\\n\\nThe earpiece are also not the ones that go inside the ear but like the ones you get on the iPhone earphones. Not very convenient in my opinion. It also impacts the sound quality as they don’t get inside the ear canal. No magnetic lock either.\\n\\nI bought this as my realme earphones stopped working exactly after one year, mostly due to the rough handling on my side. I wanted to buy the same orange realme again but while browsing saw this model, googled it and then decide to buy it because of the JBL brand.\\n\\nBeen listening on it the last few hours, and I honestly feel dissatisfied.\\nRead more',\n",

       " \"This is one of the worst earphones I have ever used.\\nDesign of the earbuds is very bad.\\nDoesn't fits well in right ear.

So, I took replacement if I received faulty item but it didn't helped.\",\n",
       " 'Every product has a head and tail after it gets quality control check from the manufacturer. Heads you win, tails you lose. If you get a good piece you are lucky and if not you have to fight for refund or replacement. This is Universal procedure. For Rs.700/- you can not expect Bose earbuds. Even in high end items same head and tail formula applies.\\nNow having said so my first piece was defective.I got replacement which is just good if not fine. Bluetooth connectivity is poor for this product otherwise rest of the functions are 4 star and if you still want a 5 star product you have to pay more for a higher quality product. For theatrical 8 D depth you can not expect that on a cheap portable device. You need soundproof and calm surroundings for that enjoyment.\\nI am in-depth music connoisseur and have tested all musical headphones, earbuds, portable speakers and home theater equipment.Comparing WeCool N1 to any such competitors at Rs.700/- is a deal.And to end my review I again repeat, if you get heads you are very lucky for the price you paid. Hope my review helps.',\n",
       " 'NOTE:\\n@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there\\'s hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.\\n@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.\\n@ You get a \" L \" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.\\n\\nI am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,\\n\\nBUILT QUALITY :\\n------------------\\n● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.\\nConnector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.\\n● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.\\n●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCOMFORT :\\n------------\\n● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.\\n● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.\\n● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nLOUDNESS :\\n-------------\\nCX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI\\n\\n● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.\\n● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.\\n● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :\\n---------------------------------------------\\nI noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.\\n● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.\\n● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.\\n● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.\\n●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :\\n----------------------------------\\n● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.\\n● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.\\n● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P\\nNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.\\n●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●\\n\\nCUSTOMER CARE :\\n--------------------\\n● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.\\n● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.\\n● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.\\nNOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.\\n●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●\\n\\nCONNECTIVITY :\\n------------------\\nAll the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.\\n\\nVERDICT :\\n----------\\nI don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.\\n\\nHope this review helps you make sound decision.\\nRead more',\n",

I'm impressed by crisp and clean sound with good bass! They are not headphones but for earbuds, they are top of my list even better than my boat which I thought were amazing.\\nYou get a nice bass at all volume levels and at higher levels the quality is still great and crisp/clear.\\n\\n⚫ Durability:\\nI can't say too much since this is a day 2 review, I am going to try and come back in a month to do a follow up on how well they are!\\nBut initial thoughts it looks durable as it comes with high quality braided cable, Mic/Volume control/3.5mm Jack all feel solid and durable.\\nWe will see how long they last from daily use as an IT professional & part-time mobile gamer. (I will also update the stars for Durability is they prove me wrong).\\n\\n⚫ Noise Cancellation: Buds are very soft & comfortable & fit very well n isolate outside noise. And gives you the freedom to use in crowded places as well\\n\\n⚫ Cons:\\nNormal 3.5mm jack (No angled jack)\\nCable above mic seems like average quality & frankly, I don't like upper side cable design\\n\\n⚫ Overall under 600, these Earphones sounds GREAT!

       " 'I loved to listen music with earphones. I have already used JBL c100si & c200si. I bought this one to gift someone. I used this JBL C50HI for 3-4 days & here are some points that will be helpful to decide to buy this or not.\\nBuild- Earbuds housing made with plastic looks basic. Wire length is 1.2mtr. It is very thin & twin wire. Wire is not tangle free. It is not feel strong & durable. One good thing is L shape 3.5mm jack so you can put in pocket while sitting without no worries. Overall build quality is average.\\n\\nSound- Sound Quality is well balanced. Bass is good,Vocals & acoustics are clear even on 100% volume. And as I said sound output is well balanced so it is loud & clear but not so much loud so you can listen music on full volume. You will feel the true JBL Sound with this earphones. I used it with OnePlus 3T.\\n\\nEarphones comes with in-line remote with single multifunctional button & Mic. Mic works good during calls.\\n\\nOverall sound output is good you can feel the True JBL Sound Output with it but build quality is not so good. It doesn’t look premium & durable.\\n\\nSuggestion- If you want listen good quality music then you can go for it but you need to use it carefully.\\nIf you want use earphones roughly then go for Realme Buds/ BOAt Earphones but you need to compromise with sound quality.\\n\\nCheck earphones videos on my YouTube channel link in my profile.\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"This is a genuine review and tested it for 2 complete days.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Battery life is good 3-4 hours with buds and around 12 additional hours with case. But should not expect this much backup of you are using volume above 80%\\n- Fits good in ears however, it depends on the ear size and shape of an individual also.\\n- The buds do not fall down during any work or workout. Did not try them while jogging/running though.\\n- Noise cancellation for calls is decent, even when it is not promised primarily. I spoke over a call for 3 hours and the call quality is good.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Volume levels are high, but not very high. With some Youtube videos, the volume levels will not be enough if you are in crowd.\\n- Bass is average, cannot have high expectations. These are not in-ear buds, hence, you'll feel the bass is low.\\n- due to smooth finish and improper shape of buds, it is difficult to take out the buds if your hands/fingers are big. They are also slippery.\\n- Touch controls are not so easy to navigate and sometimes I should repeat the command twice or thrice to get them working. Maybe I'm not much habituated to this.\\n- Touch commands are also different from other Noise/ear buds products, so getting confused when using them.\\n- When adjusting the ear bud, the long tap on the bud activates Google Assistance unnecessarily.\\n\\nOverall, the buds are too good for this price range. I don't think you should expect anything more for this deal.\\nRead more\",\n",

       "[\"Initial Review after 2 days of usage;\\n\\nHeart Rate and Steps are accurate.\\nTemperature, Sleep and SpO2 measurements are also good. However...\\nBP measurement is a complete failure... It's has 4 categories to choose from... Low, Normal, High and Very High... The readings are just based on the category you choose and has nothing to do with the actual condition or reading.. Quite disappointed... Hope this is corrected in future updates..\\n\\nOverall, kind of a good product... Please don't buy it if you are specifically looking to use it to measure your BP. Thanks!\",\n",
       " \"The packaging used by Amazon was really good.\\nComing to the packaging of the watch itself, wow, the unboxing experience was comparable to that of APPLE products, really clean.\\nAnd coming to the sensors, it has Heart rate and SpO2 sensors along with a 6 axis accelerometer.\\n1. The Heart rate sensor works fines with a margin of error of 2-3 beats per min.\\n2. The SpO2 sensor is not a gimmick, it works fine but not 100% accurate, it was of by nearly 2% every time.\\n** Both the sensors do no work if the watch is not on your hand**\\nSo both are just not for namesake and are functional.\\n**It doesn't have GPS built-in the only CON at this price.\\n**The display is pretty good and gets adequately bright.\\nComing to the battery charging time, it takes around 1.5hrs for 30-100%.\\n\\n***Update 1: The battery only lasts for 6 days, when HR set for continuous for every 10min, sleep tracking on and also notifications on for sedentary and calls and exercise tracking for 30 min a day.\\n\\nChecking SpO2 10 times a day manually and always on for stress measurement.\\n\\nLifting the watch up to light the screen for nearly 50 times a day.\\nI expected it to last for atleast 7 days though(claimed was 9 days).\\n***UPDATE 2: Using it for nearly 2 weeks now , received a firmware upgrade, and the accuracy of the SpO2 as well as the HR sensor have improved and also the battery life has improved to around 7 days now.\\n\\n****UPDATE-3( 24th Jan 2021): Using it for almost 3 months now, I guess all the hugs ar fixed, most of the measruu are accurate, but the step counter sometimes registers steps even if I don't walk :P.\\nBattery life on average 7 days with HR every 10 min and stress measurement on and daily once O2 measurement and sleep tracking.\\nThe band is pretty comfortable, no skin irritation or discomfort.\\nReceived around 6-7 updates till now.\\n\\nThis watch is a good budget choice based on my usage for almost 3 months now.\\nRead more\",\n",

The best part about this watch is how accurately it measures my Blood Oxygen levels (Spo2), Blood Pressure and BPM (beats per minute). The construction is super lightweight and feels very premium. The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight. It has a powerful battery back up of 15 days and I have used it for workouts, and the water resistance is really impressive. The included strap is also very comfortable and I have had no irritations while wearing it.',\n",
       " \"Writing a review after few days of usage.\\nIt's quite good looking watch with list of features like sleep, heartrate, step monitor and many other. But what is the use of a feature if it is not accurate in measurements. This I realized when I went on a long drive in my car and it measured 14k steps when I got down only for few minutes!!!. Quite disappointed as I feel my daily goal achievements till now are not accurate. Probably I might be taking only 5k steps in my reported steps of 10k.\\nI doubt about heartrate and sleep monitor also now. Did not expect this kind of flaw in version 2. Smart watches have been around for quite some time now and cannot expect such basic flaws now.\\nMore disappointed when I found a 2.5k MI 4 band works awesomely accurate than a 21k extravagant watch!!!\",\n",

       " \"I have been using smart watches for three year. All of them have been Fitbit. I got bored of them and was looking for a good SMWatch which is when I looked at Samsung Galaxy Active 2 LTE. Been 1 week since I started using it and I should say, this is an amazing piece of art both inside and out. The following are the highlights I noticed\\n\\n1. Beautiful round shaped ergonomically designed body dial with responsive bezel control.\\n2. Cross checked the step count and hear rate with Fitbit. Step count is super accurate. Heart rate varies 1 to 2 bpm which is OK. Very much under tolerance level.\\n3. Beautiful leather strap. Easy to pin the strap to the leather, if you are coming from Fitbit Versa you know how important this is. Also it doesn't cause any itching. But pls make sure water doesn't stay on it for long time. You may lose it soon\\n4. Auto detection of exercises are super accurate again. Walk and run is auto detected. Yet to check how it treats weights. Waiting for Gyms to reopen\\n5. Battery life is 1.5 to 2 days with heavy usage (kept exploring the watch, 4G is on and sometimes I take call in the watch. No music.) This is way lower than Fitbit. But I will get used to it I believe\\n6. U may get confused on how the trio - Phone, watch and buds - are paired. You will not be able to use ur buds if u attend a call in watch when your phone is nearby. You can use the buds only if you use the standalone watch 4G. Still exploring this area.\\n7. Bit expensive. I will give a 4 star for value for money. Again 4 star because this is probably the best smart watch available in the market\\n\\nLastly, Amazon's delivery was good. It was delayed by a day. But I understand they are prioritizing the essentials considering that this is a good service\\n\\nLet me know if anyone want any specific info and I can help with it.\\nRead more\",\n",

Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.\\n◾ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.\\n◾ IPX68 dust and waterproof.\\n◾ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring\\n◾ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n♻️ WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n◾ More exercise or activities could have been included like Badminton etc.\\n◾ Only 5 watch faces available but heard there will be more added this year.\\n\\n-------------------\\n🍱 OVERALL\\n-------------------\\nThe MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. 🥇\\nRead more\",\n",
       " 'My experience with Fire-Boltt Beast has been an amazing one. As the name suggests, it\\'s really a beast with 1.69\" HD display. The performance of this watch is great. The best part about this watch is how accurately it measures my Blood Oxygen levels (Spo2), Blood Pressure and BPM (beats per minute). The construction is super lightweight and feels very premium. The HD display is bright and has been keeping up pretty well even under direct sunlight. It has a powerful battery back up of 15 days and I have used it for workouts, and the water resistance is really impressive. The included strap is also very comfortable and I have had no irritations while wearing it.']"

       " \"An entirely capable Mirrorless camera from Sony who presented this camera as an 'Entry Level' Full Frame camera. It gives you features which most professional DSLR's cannot give, all for a body MRP of below 2 lakhs. My review about every segment of this camera:\\n\\n1- Body: Sony claims that the body is Magnesium Alloy which is only dust proof and splash proof, so you might wanna reconsider if you are going to be shooting in heavy rain or very unlikely conditions, which most of us won't be. The buttons on the back feels nice and clicky, with Sony following the same button layout as in the Sony A7R3, which was praised by photographers a lot.\\n\\n2- Performance and AF: It does a whopping 10 frame per second shooting with both Mechanical and electronic shutter, and has the same Autofocus system in the Sony A9, which is a 3 lakh INR camera! This is insane! The interesting part is, the AF points cover about 93% of the screen, so it is a great feature to have while recording video. It also has the legendary Eye-AF, which was introduced in the A7R3, and works like a charm. One thing though, is that you can't use Eye-AF while recording video, it is applicable only for photography.\\n\\n3- Photography and Video Features: It has a 24MP Backlit CMOS sensor, which means that it should have better low light performance since it is backlit. And yes, it does! The low light performance even outruns the A7R3, and this camera. is a beast in low light! Taking portraits should be easier since it has the Eye AF, and it is very much ideal for photography of fast moving subjects. The Autofocus tracking is absolutely wonderful, and if you're using native Sony lenses, then you shouldn't have any problems at all. Another advantage is the crop mode in this camera, which only utilises the APS-C size of the sensor. You can still attach your crop sensor lenses and still get awesome stills and video without any Vignetting.\\nThe movie recording capabilities of this camera blows most of the pro-DSLR's out of the water. 4K 30fps, and 1080p upto 120fps. And the quality of the footage looks much more improvised when comparing it to older models like the A6300. You get all the Professional Picture Profiles in Video as well!\\n\\n4- Battery Life: Since Sony is using the new Z-series batteries for this camera, battery life is significantly improved. I could shoot for a whole day(both clips and stills) and still had 30% battery at the end of the day. It's good to have one more battery though.\\n\\n5. Who is it for: Well, for the features it offers, it definitely is a Pro camera. But at this price point, it can be used by anyone who wants a Full Frame Camera to start off! It is absolutely a Bang for the Buck camera(if only more) and it is a pleasure carrying it around and shooting with it! If you are a landscape photographer and wants more Megapixels than 24MP for cropping in, then I would suggest the A7R3 or even the A7R2! The A7R2 is still a very capable camera with similar features, but terrible battery life and average AF capability. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE SONY A73 TO ABSOLUTELY ANYONE WHO HAS AN INTEREST AND THE BUDGET TO BUY THIS CAMERA!\\n\\nENJOY THE CAMERA! YOU ARE GONNA BUY YOURSELF A BEAST!\\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"I have a mi security camera already and I am using it since one year. After the lockdown, it went out of stock but soon arrived at Amazon but it's cost had increased. Even then I went ahead and tried to purchase it as I had prior confidence but just before buying Amazon showed me a feature comparison with this camera (tapo c200). So my review would be largely a comparison of the two with a breakup of the features of both security cameras.\\n\\nOn the feature front, this tapo camera beats mi security camera hands down. It comes with home monitoring, call/talk back feature just as mi security camera but additionally has privacy feature to switch off recording, alarm on/off on detection of movement, clean user interface, advanced self diagnosis feature, auto reboot feature and 128gb sdcard storage as against no privacy feature and 64gb in mi security camera. Also on detection of movement, mi security camera records multiple clips of max 1 min duration whereas tapo doesn't have that recording constraint. This is the biggest disadvantage of mi security camera. The setup took time as my WiFi was hidden and camera didn't recognize the hidden network even though I manually added it. But finally to overcome that, I made my WiFi network discoverable, once tapo recognized and stored it, I once again hid my WiFi and tapo didn't have any problem.\\n\\nAesthetics of tapo are however not that good as mi security camera. mi security camera feels premium when touched physically. However when you touch tapo, you get a cheap Chinese feeling which I hated when I opened the box. Moreover tapo rotates from its bottom and the rotating diameter is large. Mi security camera rotates from its middle point and the rotating diameter is consequently smaller.\\n\\nOther than the rotating and aesthetics, tapo wins quite handsomely. If you want a premium feeling ( which no longer matters once the camera is setup) go for mi security camera otherwise go for tapo c200 and enjoy the rich features at a lesser price.\\n\\nWill update more about its longevity in future.\\n\\nUpdate1: After 3 months I realized that after inserting SD card, the initialisation time has increased by more than two minutes whereas in mi camera, the initialisation time hasn't noticeably changed. So mi camera wins here.\\n\\nUpdate 2: Recording and browsing of recording in sd card in tapo is better but when tapo records any video on detection of any Movement, the green light of the camera turns to red. Also when night mode switches on, one can hear the relay sound from tapo easily. Mi camera continues to emit blue light even while recording and no relay sound comes out of Mi camera when night mode switches on. So Mi camera wins here again.\\n\\nUpdate 3: in case of motion detection, mi camera takes an estimated 8-9 minutes to process the feed and send you a notification. That is, if a person/motion is detected at 8:00pm in front of camera, you will receive a notification only at 8:09 pm. In case of tapo, this is 4-5 minutes with a buzzer/alarm feature.

Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied it.\\n\\nApple urges people not to close their MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook!!! It may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.\\n\\nMacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. This item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!\\n\\nIf you are going to use it on your MacBook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. You can use it without worry on iMac as it's a desktop and doesn't get closed. You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn't embedded inside the glass screen. If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.\\n\\nFor disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options. One is you trust Apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. According to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.\\nIf you're not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don't see how there could be an issue.\\n\\nWhy am I still giving this product 3 stars? It reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. It's not a bad product.

       " 'I ordered the \"Amazon Basic Hard Camera Case\" after a lot a deliberation. My son primarily needed a storage solution for the expensive camera lenses. Something which is sturdy; blocks humidity; doesn\\'t takes much space in the room (or cupboard) and which doesn\\'t burns a hole in the pocket .\\n\\nSo we researched and the choice basically was between a \"Hard Case\" or a \"Dry Cabinet\". We finally went for the hard case solution because we felt that it had the tripe advantages of - Durability; Ease of Storage & Portability.\\n\\nThe price seemed on the higher side but we still went for this brand of hard case because we trusted the quality of products from the \"Amazon Basics\" stable. Our past experience with purchase of Amazon Basics products had us confident that the product price may seem high but the quality will also be superior to its peers in same or higher price bracket.\\n\\nThe product was delivered within the promised period. It was very well packaged in a strong cardboard carton and cling film. In side the carton the \"Case\" was packed after being padded with adequate protection.\\n\\nThe product\\'s feel was premium in the hands, The body is made of strong poly-carbonate material, stronger than the regular suitcases. It felt strong and sturdy, just by the weight of the empty case itself.\\n\\nThe exteriors do not do justice to the plush interior of the case. It has Egg-crate Foam on the upper side and 3 layers of pre-cut Polyethylene Foam on the lower side (where you keep the equipment).\\n\\nWe were able to easily cut deeper grooves as per the size of our equipment and in no time had them placed securely and snugly in the case.\\n\\nThe case has a hard plastic seal on the edge of the lower section which helps make it completely airtight once you close and latch it.\\n\\nThere are two side latches and circular air tight lock in the center. The case also had a silica gel pouch which we placed inside it along with the equipment, it works against humidity.\\n\\nI would have given it 5 stars for \"Value for money\" had the price been closer to 5K than 6.5K, but at the same time I also understand its a small price if it keeps the much more expensive Camera lenses safe from breakage and humidity.\\n\\nOverall a satisfying buy. Highly recommended if you are looking for a dependable camera case. Please see pictures for the capacity and product look & feel. Cheers !!\\nRead more',\n",

This printer was purchased from Amazon in March 2019, the warranty for the product (as per HP site) had started in December 2018!\\n2.

No instructions on how to make the Manual Duplex feature work from a Print option (at least on MacOS)\\n4. Knowledgeable/ trouble shooting guides have no information on this\\n5. Due to Ink-Tank feature, it is not easy to just \"pick-up\" the printer & carry it - it has to be kept horizontal to avoid ink spills, so carrying to an HP service centre is out of question.\\n6. The Chat Bot on HP website cannot answer anything that you cannot read in a manual - it is totally useless & does not even recognise that it should redirect the person to a human.\\n7. All support information is for Windows devices - not help for Mac OS is available\\n8. Still trying to figure out how to talk to a support representative as they are available only during my working hours or shorter & I have not been able to find an option to leave a message/ email for help.\\nIn short - very good product when it works, but support seems to suck.

Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.\\n\\nThe only downside was the default setup this machine comes with. I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.\\n\\nAnyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.\\n\\nEDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn\\'t, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en\\n\\nGo to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up \"Network\" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.\\n\\nOn your printer, press Menu button and :\\n1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static\\n2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.\\n3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.\\n\\nAfter following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don\\'t follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default.\\nRead more',\n",

       " \"I purchased this printer a few months ago and have used it for several printouts till now. I had to b really thoughtful about its feedback , simply because buying printers online is quite a challenging decision especially the notorious reviews posted by many. At the end you trust your gut and make a decision. For most of the time people desire everything for the lowest price possible however please bear in mind quality demands research and money! So this is what i feel about the printer -\\n1. It looks great. Infact it looks pretty classy.\\n2. I love the print quality. It does so much justice for the image you want to print.\\n3. I paid 4890/- for the printer. The image print output is pretty satisfactory.\\n4. I printed a lot of sheets. Like, i totally went crazy with my print outs. I was working on a vision board project (more like a vision wall) and It required quite a bit of printouts. I hate going to the printer shops with the images I want to print as I have privacy issues. But so happy this printer did not even fuss once and facilitated smooth and steady printouts.\\n5. The installation was a cakewalk. It is compatible with my iPhone and Mac. Easy peasy. I love user friendly technology.\\n6. I have always inserted one sheet at a time. Why? because i find that arrangement quite hassle free and convenient.\\n7. A couple of times the paper got jammed. #commonprinterproblems. I did not feel that I should mind that. Given the convenience of home printing. Everything is better at home.\\n8. I took prints on regular sheets as well as glossy sheets. I would tell you this- , sheet type hardly made a difference. In future i'd use a regular sheet. Not a glossy one. I just tried glossy because may be I expected 'photo print quality'. While the print quality was great, the final print washed out the glossy effect. So it is redundant.\\n9. The printer uses the 803 ink cartridge and that is where the catch is.\\n10. 803 print cartridges clearly read that they are disposable and meant for single use only.\\n11. The original cartridge exhausted quite early. I am able to say this as I later ordered the refill ink and refilled my cartridge and I was able to get more prints this time. (It might be because with the original cartridge I printed glossy papers and they consume more ink. MAY BE. I'm just guessing.)\\n12. I watched a couple of Youtube videos and learnt how to refill the cartridge. I followed instructions and Viola! my printer started to shoot prints again.\\n13. Now , when you refill the original cartridge the printer's ink indicator does not read it. Which you'll learn to adapt because in moments your printer will be shooting pages after pages.\\n14. SO after several and many prints It was time to refill the cartridge. and Guess what...It did not work. I tried everything. The prints turned out horrible. The ink was spilling all over. Even inside the printer and that made me very sad. Nobody likes a tardy looking gadget!\\n15. My conclusion is that HP is right. 803 does not allow a refill. Even though the ink sellers claim and list that it does...It does not.\\n16. The first refill was may be a lucky shot. It worked. I was very happy. The second refill was a complete fiasco.\\n17. Eventually I discarded the cartridges.\\n18. I logged in to Amazon and wanted to place order for fresh cartridges and guess what. Out of all the HP models , 803 has the most expensive cartridge. That made me very thoughtful and cautious.\\n19. Unless HP does something about the price of the Ink cartridges, the ink will blot your enthusiasm.\\nMy verdict - It is a great printer. I love it. Love the print quality. But 803 is an EXORBITANTLY PRICED ink cartridge. May be i'll try the refills again when my next cartridge arrives and update my review just in case i am successful beyond the first refill attempt. (UPDATE- the refill completely did not work with next new cartridge ran dry. Also I noticed that the new cartridge printed half the amount of papers from last time. Not sure of the decline)\\nI am not complaining because ultimately I have to take everything into consideration. But going to the printer shop is a BIG NO for me.\\n\\nReview Update 7th March- I realized the cartridge purchased from Amazon I.e 803 for this printer is not compatible. My printer didn’t read the color cartridge. It was an old generation piece and the black ink cartridge leaked during printing. It basically suggests that the cartridges are either refilled or not genuine. I later purchased them from HP website. Even though expensive I was content about the fact that they are genuine and have same business day delivery. I love the Amazon returns policy. They accepted the opened cartridge and refunded quite promptly.\\n\\nReview Update - Jan 24- it’s been six months the printer has been completely useless and I e been wondering what to do with it. Selling it on OLX seems like I’ll be cheating the buyer. I switched to a new ISP and the printer would not connect. I registered the call with HP CS . There was a lot of hassle. After spending around 72 hours back and forth they sent a technician. The printer just didn’t detect any connection with the phone, laptop and the WiFi. Technician refused to take any responsibility and said Ive been entering the password wrong. The technician and customer service people were so smart to place the blame because apparently the only device not connecting to the WiFi amongst the whole list of gadgets was the printer.\\nFinal Review is that as excited I was , it fizzled out so bad, that it is ridiculous to even think of giving the machine away for free as I’ll lose face if someone asks for a demo! I thought I’ll bear with the super highly priced ink but for a printer that doesn’t sync or connect, it’s a waste! It’s like a marriage which you realize is going bad within 6 months of being married! The benefit with the printer being - you have the freedom to discard it!\\nInterestingly I also feel that the shelf life of this printer is meant to last only for one bundle of sheets you buy. The printer exhausts post that! If you’re looking for a heavy use...you must buy the really expensive ones! Yes. That’s true.\\nHP customer service experience is 0/10.\\nRead more\",\n",

Afterwards I willingly downloaded brother plugins and mopria print service which also helped me print smoothly but one day when commanded to print PDFs of pages more than 25, it took very considerable time to respond.

       " 'IMPORTANT NOTE:\\n\\nFirst off all, getting a good surround system is dependent not only on the speakers but many other factors. Your experience is going to be poor no matter which sound system you buy unless you consider for these factors.\\n\\nTo get a good surround sound system you should consider:\\n\\n1. Whether the content you\\'re playing has a 5.1ch sound output in the first place\\n\\n2. Whether the app and/or device you\\'re playing it in supports a 5.1ch output (for e.g. YouTube app does not have a 5.1ch output)\\n\\n3. Whether your connectivity supports a 5.1ch output; not all devices/connections support 5.1ch (for e.g. if you connect the speakers through a normal 3.5mm jack, you\\'ll only get a stereo output)\\n\\nSo when comments here say the \"5.1 doesn\\'t work\" take that not with a pinch of salt but with \\'bunch\\' of salt.\\n\\nI have been using the sound system for a little over 2 months and I can say with 100% confidence that it works with absolute charm!!\\n\\nTherefore before you go ahead and make this purchase, please do find out if the device that you intend to hook this up with, has the capability to output 5.1ch through HDMI Arc connection. Not all TVs/devices support this, therefore you\\'ll end up having all the devices but not getting the surround system feel.\\n\\nNow coming to the sound system in itself.\\n\\nIt is a bit of a bummer that the Front Right, Centre and Front Left are in a single sound bar. Ideally you would want them to be slightly spaced. But there is the advantage of the soundbar fitting snugly right below the TV and looking pretty cool. It does give an artificial \"spacing\", so no complains here.\\n\\nThe Surround Left and Right satellites come with a 10m long wire. They need to be placed at 90-110° from where you sit and since most ideal TV viewing distances are less than 4m, there shouldnt be a problem with lack of length.\\n\\nPlease Google for speaker placement for 5.1ch and you\\'ll come across Dolby recommended positions. Follow that and you\\'re good to go!\\n\\nThe sound itself is amazing! Gives a very good cinematic experience (assuming you have considered all the aforementioned 3 factors). With HDMI Arc connectivity, you should be able to control the speaker volume with your TV remote itself, but this is something that you need to check with your TV.\\nRead more',\n",

But i didn't want to compromise in audio quality.\\nThis delivers what i needed, i. e. Correct frequency response. Some people complaining about low bass, let me mention it gives sound signature of JBL audio .it gives pure bass pleasant to ears not unnecessary booming like roadside dhoom dhadaka..i hope you understand what i am trying to say..i returned blaupunkt as the bass was extra boomy that ruins the melody of music..some people likes it but i don't. I prefer balanced sound signature. This delivers perfect bass response and the punch comes when it is needed..it is a mark of great sound signature..i can assure that after listening this even audiophiles will not complain. Maybe people who complaining about bass must replace their product, i am sure they got defective item.\\nIt doesn't have bass and treble control feature but why someone need to disturb the sound signature by tweaking it. I don't feel any need, though it can be done with phone equalizer.\\nOne addition - it has 3 equalizer preset modes present on remote. That works perfectly. game, music and cinema\\n\\nLoudness is more than enough, i haven't played it at full volume as my windows started vibrating so i lowered it down. No one wants complains from neighbours.\\n\\nComing to build quality. It is perfect nothing to complain in this section.\\n\\nIt is the best one could get in this price range.\\nUsually i don't write reviews but i struggled a lot while ordering this unit as there was not a single review available for this, i hope this will help others a little bit.\\nRead more\",\n",

       " 'Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best.

       " \"I received this router last week which is also known as AX50. I was overexcited of getting WiFi 6 router. I overlooked some review on amazon about how it heats up when placed on flat surface and ordered myself as I needed a gigabyte router and thought to invest in the new technology. So far I can summarize some of the issues I came across on this router (I have around 10 Tp-link routers at this point, from cheapest to N to dual band.)\\n\\n1. It does heat up considerably from top and bottom middle portion. If I have to keep this router and no firmware can fix this, you have to install a PC cabinet fan under it to help remove the heat.\\n2. This router doesn't provide Bridging/WDS functionality that all other routers that I have from tp-link has. Very disappointed as this functionality is present even in the least expensive tp-link router.\\n3. The range of 2.4 GHz is no better than cheapest tp-link single band dual antenna that cost around 1000 rs has so disappointed with 2.4GHz WiFi performance.\\n4. 5 GHz band is as usual have short range. The 5 GHz AC can connect to any device with a maximum of 1200 Mbps link speed, even if supported WiFi adapter maximum speed is higher to 1200mbps. If only AX mode is selected, router can connect to AX device to maximum of 2400 Mbps but it will not run AC mode. With mix mode with AC and AX, the maximum connection speed reduces to 1200 Mbps even for AX devices. So, this router is called AX router with 2400 Mbps for 5GHz or a AX router with 1200 Mbps that can connect to AC devices too, so it is misleading on part of TP-link. I shared the same on their forum but no response from their representative.\\n5. Channel numbers for each band seems to change from those set in the admin configuration page after few session so if any bridge router connected to this AX router, it will disconnect.\\n6. Ethernet Gigabit ports is maxing out at around 750 mbps read and 350 mbps write speed. I used CAT 7 cable to test the speed in my internal network. With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.\\n7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test. This is disappointing result as this results is what I can get with older tp-link C5 router.\\n8. With Intel AX200NGW wifi 6 160 MHz adapter, I could connect to the router with 2400 Gbps connection.\\n9. This router doesn't support tp-link OneMesh functionality which allow to connect other router to form a internet mesh to avoid wifi deadspots in home or office.\\n\\nFor configurations, I have disabled Airtime Fairness and OFDMA. I have enabled MU-MIMO as my laptop Killer's wifi adapter 1550i supports it. Smart connect is disconnected. One ethernet and 2 wlan devices are connected to the router. AX functionality is not yet tested as I still have to install Intel's wifi 6 AX200NGW adapter to my laptop. Router is running on new firmware as mentioned in the details.\\n\\nI did some test to get AX performance of the router. I enabled OFDMA, from 20 MHz till 160 MHz and MU MIMO functions for 5 GHz band and did all test with wifi router 1feet from the laptop equipped with Intel AX200NGW 160MHz wifi adapter. The test was done using Synology Diskstation connected to the router Gigabit port. Diskstation is capable of read and write of over 800 Mbps.\\nChannel number 120 (DFS) Below is the test results:\\n\\n20MHz - Writing 98.33 Mbps reading 166.51 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 287 Mbps\\n40MHz - Writing 125 Mbps reading 250 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 574 Mbps\\n80MHz - Writing 180 Mbps reading 350 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps\\n160MHz - Writing 165 Mbps reading 370 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps\\n160MHz - Writing 190 Mbps reading 400 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 2400 Mbps\\n\\nFurther I tested the USB 3.0 speed by connecting a Lexar Triton USB 3 with maximum speed 170 read and 170 write speed. I got no more than 15 MBps in write and 25 MBps in read when router was connected with 2400 Mbps speed. The result of these transfer is again disappointing .\\n\\nOther star attraction feature of QoS and parental control won't work if you have no tp-link id and internet connection. For this id, you have to give personal information and potential risk of direct connection of this router to some Chinese company which, if they want, they can access all of your devices connected to this router.\\n\\nIn view of my observations since last 2 days and several test as mentioned above, I believe that this router is not worth the money spend.\\nBridging/WDS function removed and AX band and USB 3 actual transfer rate as well as 2.4 GHz range are mediocre at best. Heat generation is another big issue to the longevity of the device.\\nRead more\",\n",

It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.\\n\\nThinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints.

It served me well for 11 years.\\n\\nEven after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.\\n\\nDelivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points\\n\\nA) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.\\n\\nB) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.\\n\\nC) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.\\n\\nD) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.\\n\\nE) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.\\n\\nF) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.\\n\\nG) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.\\n\\nH) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.\\n\\nI) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.\\n\\nJ) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.\\n\\nK) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.\\n\\nL) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.\\n\\nPackage has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.\\n\\nSummarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.\\n\\nI will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.\\n\\nFeel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.\\n\\nEdit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.\\n\\nSet up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.\\n\\nIf you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.\\n\\nEdit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.\\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"I bought it two days back. It is working properly. My only issue is with the pricing. It costs nearly 2k when there are local UPS which can run computers for that price(it won't run a router as the power requirement is too low and annoying sound is unbearable). A 6000 Mah battery and nothing much is there in the product, I agree there is no need of anything else. 2k for such a product cannot be justified. The only reason why I bought this product is because I couldn't find any other reliable solution for power problem. If this thing breaks within an year, it will be a huge loss(6 months warranty is provided by Resonate).\",\n",
       " 'I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.\\nLet me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can\\'t get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won\\'t say that the dlink gets location advantage here.\\nIt looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can\\'t send the data in a sustained manner.\\nI bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.\\nI don\\'t want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.\\nAnother warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.\\nAnother caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said \"WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE\". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.\\nI hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don\\'t let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.\\n\\nThanks,\\nDebojit\\nThanks,\\nDebojit\\nRead more',\n",
       " 'This product sucks. The 5ghz only works fine but 2.5ghz never worked good the speed of it keeps fluctuating. my 40mbps plan was reduced to 20 and then if i go a bit distance then it is reduces to 8mbps. i would say rather buy a single band branded one for this price.

       " \"This is a totally bogus thing with bogus claims. Firstly it's claims are ludicrous. The explanation on how it works in one of the product images here on amazon are laughable. Just to prove this point I searched MIT tech review and unsurprisingly there is no such article where they reviewed such a product. Web search on Singapore council's attestation for the product too came out with no results. They say patented technology but cited no patent number -anybody's guess why.\\n\\nThere is no such thing as toxicity to EM radiation at the feeble power levels that electronic devices emit. Many credible studies worldwide have come out negative on the health effects due to this radiation. People should get wise enough to drown bogus companies like envirochip who intend to make quick money cashing in on technological ignorance of general public.\",\n",

You can also download the EShare app and mirror your smartphone to the TV. Although, it is quite irritating and confusing to type or gesture. The picture quality is definitely not like Sony Bravia or anything, so don't expect to be wowed. It's somewhat grainy, but it isn't that bad either. Audio is clear, not crisp. I tried calling their toll free number for installation, but it seems to be out of order. So, I've booked an UrbanClap professional to get it wall-mounted asap. Installation charge is 500 rs. YouTube, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix apps are pre-installed. I probably will have to download Hotstar and Amazon Prime apps from the play store. In YouTube, there's no option of signing in.

It didn\\'t shut off even after 15 minutes.\\n(2) Connected only Wifi router with mains off. It shut down after 5 minutes.\\n(3) Then, immediately I connected a hairdryer (a high power drawing device). It runs successfully for 10+ minutes.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s not the fault of battery or the UPS, it\\'s our expectation that it should work for Wifi routers alone.\\nFor me, 5 minutes is OK.\\nBut for folks expecting more than that, one workaround is to connect a higher power drawing device like Monitor or TV or Laptop charger along with Wifi router. It shouldn\\'t shut down.\\n\\nI hope this review is useful for future purchasers.\\nRead more',\n",

The most important thing I would like to mention is you can use 2 devices with different power requirements at the same time.

I have tested 30 mins or so switching off the input power and it works like a charm.\\n\\nUpdate 1: after simulating power failure it gave me a backup of exactly 6 hrs with 2 devices running. Now the worst part is, when I turned the input power back the ups started charging but to my surprise the devices were not getting any power. Well I realized that I had to manually turn the ups on with the button switch on the router!! That is something I was not expecting at all.

The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box.

These are best in budget. They have LED, two seperate jacks and those cushions are super comfy.

But should not expect this much backup of you are using volume above 80%\\n- Fits good in ears however, it depends on the ear size and shape of an individual also.\\n- The buds do not fall down during any work or workout. Did not try them while jogging/running though.\\n- Noise cancellation for calls is decent, even when it is not promised primarily. I spoke over a call for 3 hours and the call quality is good.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Volume levels are high, but not very high. With some Youtube videos, the volume levels will not be enough if you are in crowd.\\n- Bass is average, cannot have high expectations. These are not in-ear buds, hence, you'll feel the bass is low.\\n- due to smooth finish and improper shape of buds, it is difficult to take out the buds if your hands/fingers are big. They are also slippery.\\n- Touch controls are not so easy to navigate and sometimes I should repeat the command twice or thrice to get them working. Maybe I'm not much habituated to this.\\n- Touch commands are also different from other Noise/ear buds products, so getting confused when using them.\\n- When adjusting the ear bud, the long tap on the bud activates Google Assistance unnecessarily.\\n\\nOverall, the buds are too good for this price range.

The sound quality of this beast will blow ur mind, I have lost my mind with the amount of bass it provides, loudness is god level. About sound there is not even 1% of problem. The problem is with COMFORT. The bigger 12mm driver compared to 9mm in the ex110ap, ex150ap makes u feel it is bigger, u can't comfortably sleep sideways having this beast plugged into ur ears.

So for Amazon delivery I will give 1 star. For the headphones I have been listening to them for the last 2 days and it's still early days. The sound quality is amazing and it does block out the outside noise. The 2 jacks provided with the headphones are very good material. I had plugged 1 into my phone and the other to my PC. sound is very clear and you can hear the beats clearly. Headphone is made of good material and it can easily fit over large heads. You might feel discomfort over the ears but that would easily be if u r listening to the headphones for more then 2 hours otherwise the cushion on the ear cups is of great quality. I specially went for this since I think bluetooth headphones don't provide that great sound as compared to non bluetooth ones.

It's sound quality is like best at its price segment and better than high priced product too.\\nIt fits into the ear like perfect fitting. It will not come out even you swing your head hardly.\\nIt has a decent look that doesn't even get noticed like very subtle.\\nIts mic quality is also decent.\\nAnd now for what you have come so far\\nCons:\\nIt shows of having a battery life upto 8 hours but it doesn't giving even 5 hours of continuous use.\\nIts bluetooth connectivity is also poor. It's connection get blocked by a single wall. That means you can't use it in your home but if you use it in open place,you will get a range of 10 m.\\nIts mic sound get distortion at the other end when you are on a call.\\nIt got a very bad phrases which interupt your music which I heard most people are complaining.\\nIt got some bad software sync with your phone. Like you charged it, you are using it and it doesn't show a battery drop after use and you think that it giving a great battery life but its not. That level drop drastically like from 100 to 50 directly and then you think that its a defected piece but its not. So this is also a issue.\\nAnd at last, when you are on call it cut little sound from the other side like blocking signals. Its the earphone issue.\\n\\nNow conclusion,\\nIf you want to get a great sounding earphone, go for 550 pro/sport which come at same price.\\nAll in one word, I am not recommending these as you can't buy this only for sound.\\nAnd you can get my point from the above mentioned issues.\\n\\nHope ypu liked the review.\\nThanks\\nRead more\",\n",

However it didn't affect me much even if it had a support.\\n\\nOverall Verdict :-\\n\\nGood headphones if someone is more towards the brand Sony and has a tight budget of not more than 9-10k since the sennheiser ones sometimes comes at a price of 11-12k with similar features. You can anyways buy a hardshell headphone case for 600-700 INR. ANC does it's job pretty well in the price range especially compared to any other in the same price bracket. Gives a decent fit for majority. Battery life is good about 30-35 hours and charging time is not that much as well, close to 1.5-2 Hours for a full charge. If someone is already using phones with USB-C type then i would say you don't even require to take out the charging cable of sony.\\n\\nBetter option for people with higher budget :- Sony WH-XB900N\\n\\nBest Price :- I would say the price which i bought it for (8991 INR incl. of 1000 INR off) was possibly the best price out there if you wish to buy it from trustable websites. Wait for some credit cards discount and then buy it.\\n\\nReason for a 4 stars Review :-\\n\\nThere is nothing so unique about these headphones which makes it stand apart from the competitors at this price point. Does it's job pretty well but yeah an app support or toggle btw. 2 devices would have given it a 5 stars rating.\\nMight just be a reason that after reviewing it's Sony WH-XB900N, i expected a bit too much. :P\\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"Been using these for 2 days now and have a few observations.\\n\\nPros:\\nSound quality - It is pretty damn good. It is correctly named the Bassbuds because the bass is truly something nice here. I was pleasantly surprised with it. The highs are a bit on the muted aise though. The sound isn't as fuller as I had hoped it to be. But at least the bass is nice!\\n\\nValue for money: These truly are value for money.\\n\\nBattery backup: Fhe battery backup is decent. But rather low of you listen at full volume and songs with high amount of bass.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\nBuild quality: The build quality is the worst thing about this. It truly shows that it is budget oriented. The plastic used is pretty bad. Both in headphones and the base unit. Sometimes it feels like you will break it just opening up the base unit. The headsets also feel very flimsy. Feels like the buttons will break pretty soon.\\nMy unit in particular feels a bit defective, the headsets are rather loose in the base unit, and just closing the base unit's door sometimes ends up moving the headset in it and it stops charging and the hesdphone turns on thinking it has been removed from the base unit\\n\\nI wanted to rate it higher and I would have, but the build quality leaves a lot to be desired.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"the worst product ever I have seen.. waste of money..not at all worth, I had returned the same product, which was just broken by opening from package, the replacement of the sme is also worst received, ultimately its a worst. pls don't buy\",\n",
       " \"Looks like comination of boat 225 and boat 100. Most important thing is they doesn't slip from ears like 225. Very light weighted as boat 100 but sounds like 225. And they look very premium & stylish like 225. Once you plugged it into your ears you don't even feel it & they don't slip from ears like 225, & whoever used 225 knows that, this is the thing we get irritate of. So I specially recommend to everyone who wanted a budget earphone. Well I my writing such a long review because may be I am the first who bought this & writing review.....\",\n",
       " 'Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.\\nRead more',\n",
       " \"1. These bluetooth headset comes with LDAC bluetooth codec capable of transmitting 960 kbps bitrate songs. But note that those songs are not your average mp3 format songs. You will need FLAC or WAV format of songs which are either chargeable or very few songs available to download from torrent. Only then you can enjoy the full capability of these oppo enco m31.\\n2. No doubt they sound better than any base centric earphones. They have titanium drivers which speaks quality.\\n3. The battery life is based on what you listen to, if you going to download those high bitrate songs which are nearly 25 ot 30 mb size then only keep the LDAC option switched on in bluetooth settings. Otherwise no use. Note: people with no knowledge about audio straight can buy oneplus wireless z since they only provide good battery life.\\n4. The battery life is 9 hrs continuous (mp3 format 320 kbps audio) with LDAC it should give you near about 6 to 7 hrs.\\n5. The build is as good as OnePlus. Not necessary the wires need to be thick to be good in quality. Misconception. EVERY BLUETOOTH HEADSET SHOULD BE USED WITH CARE ELSE BUY WIRED EARPHONES.\\n5. Please burn your drivers before concluding the sound quality for atleast 2 to 3 days.\\n6. Call quality is as good. Nothing around 5k will give you pindrop background noise cancellation. So expect certain high pitch background noise to infiltrate. Oneplus wireless Z has a mic a little bit higher on the earphone wire makes no difference. It's hardly 1 or more half inch close to mouth which practically makes no sense.\\n7. The earphones fit so good. I've never tried anything better in my life. You can even sleep side ways wearing in-ear earphones. This is a dream come true.\\n8. Charging port is open. Should have been covered with some rubber clip at the least. No idea how will this age, only time can tell.\\n9. Do select a proper size buds for yourself, only then you will enjoy the real experience.\\n10. Don't wait for your battery to fall 10%. Charge it when it's near 30% upto 90%. This way you can keep your battery healthy and long lasting.\\n11. Base boost mode is good. But only turn on if you are in that zone of listening to just a few bass heavy songs or when your outdoors and can't pay attention to real instruments in background. Else balance mode is perfectly tuned.\\n12. Just like OnePlus wireless Z even oppo enco m31 has quick switch. You'll need to press volume -/+ together to switch between your 2 devices.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"The sound is awesome, dont expect deep bass from it. Excellent if you're more concerned about mids and highs. The size is a bit bulky, so you might not find it comfortable if using for a long time, this will also depend on the fit as not everyone would have the same kind of fit. Touch responsiveness is too good, people who are complaining either have a faulty product or unaware of where the touch sensors are. Will update the review after a few weeks of usage.\\n\\nUpdate#1: Wearing it for over 2 hours will cause significant amount of pain and discomfort. Would not recommend using it for long duration. Battery life is good, can easily last ~4hours with medium sound level. But the irony is that you wouldn't be able to wear it that long :P\\n\\nUpdate#2: A lot of people would complaint about reducing battery life. It very important that you follow charging instructions. The case needs to be charged at 1amp,not more. These batteries can not handle higher charging currents. Its not compulsory to charge it to a 100%. I have been using a dedicated 1amp charger to charge this and other devices like smartwatch\",\n",
       " 'After using 4 to 5 days i would like to say as followings\\n1. Sound quality is good and clear with reasonable bass. But it is really clear\\n2. It is good value for money.\\n3. I have used it for continuously 2-3 hours when driving the bike with helmet. There will be no problem atall for ear also bluetooth connection.\\n4. I have checked that battery goes up to 6 - 7 hours with 70% volume and believe that 70% percent volume seems to be more than sufficient .\\n5. Noise cancellation is good.\\n6. Only notable thing is the right side seems to be little bit more loud in comparison to left side . But after some time believe me u could not feel any difference.\\n7. Neckband is good and stylish.\\nI am satisfied with this at this price point.\\n8.It is better than samsung u level bluetooth wireless phone.\\n9. Lastly i have also purchased BASS EVOLUTION wireless earphone. I feel this is also good and better bass than wings glide.\\nMy last conclusion is Wings glide is good\\nBut BASS EVOLUTION is very good interms of Bass. Thank you.\\nRead more']"

       "[\"First of all, Xbox is not for me as its exclusive game library is not as good, and the ones that are, can be played on PC! Moreover, I dont think the upcoming Series S is worth it, as its has meagre 512GB storage (of which usable will be even less) and since its only digital, over a long term, its gonna be expensive as hell.\\nNow, I only own a 1080p 60Hz monitor. so the question boiled down to whether higher FPS and next-gen features like load times and ray tracing were important enough for 40k-50k price for ps5.\\nThe answer is that they are important, but not this early in the life-cycle. That said, I am mostly looking forward to the ps5 slim whenever it comes. At that point, games will properly utilize these features also. Moreover, you can install SSD into PS4 to cut load times by upto 50%!\\nTherefore, I went ahead for this sweet piece of hardware that is ps4. In addition, if you have been following, ps4 is receiving heavy discounts on digital games. Fifa20 was recently <300Rs!, just 1-2 years later from like 3000+!!!. All games look really pretty and run smoothly (30FPS). Not to forget most of the newer PS5 titles will be available for PS4 in next 1-2 years!\\nAnd TBH, I really don't care about graphics that much. What we should really focus on is the entire experience (including story, acting, gameplay), which is where PS4 heavily outclasses the pros of xbox bandwagon, and even ps5 (albeit only in terms of price of games, which are going to drop for ps4 post PS5 release).\\nImagine owning several games like Jedi: Fallen Order (giving a cross-platform example for reference). Well that right there is the ps4 experience! I am talking about God of War, Uncharted, The Last of us series, Heavy Rain, Beyond two souls, Ghosts of Tsushima, Shadow of colossus, Until Dawn, The Order: 1886 among many others. Spiderman is for childhood memories (I still remember playing the very first 3d one) and Days Gone for casual fun.\\nRead more\",\n",
       " \"hello,plzz note this that you will not get any hard copy or any paper..you will get code on your Amazon account. check your Amazon account after buying. i was waiting for hard copy for 10 days. didn't knew that code is in email.thanks,good and legit seller.\",\n",
       " \"Say 🎉welcome home to the new baby👽, Live Tech To! Man wireless gamepad🎊. Live Tech is a chinese company which excels in making gamepads for Android Mobiles and also IOS. This new gamepad unlike the previous generation is also compatible with pc wireless gaming and supports Android TV's too.\\nJust so as to make it clear right of the bat, this particular series excels particularly in Android TV and Android Box Gaming😻. It also supports the mobile gaming to a certain extent by downloading the app on your Android device which you are free to explore.\\nNow, the question is, who should buy this gamepad?🤔- Well I for one felt that this gamepad is a heaven-sent for those in dilemma such as myself searching for a android box compatible gamepad. I recently bought Mi Box 4k for which I needed a gamepad to play games such as Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2 as well as GTA😉...This particular gamepad worked flawlessly on the box, just by pressing LB+Home Button at the same time after the usb has been plugged in the socket (feel free to refer to my example in the pictures). It connects and recognises it within 1.5 seconds so it's good (that is to say instantly). I also connected it with my laptop usb and was able to play Steins;Gate (a Virtual lightnovel game) and others such as the Walking Dead by Tell Tales. Since I don't do heavy gaming you need to check it out yourself. I have also uploaded the instruction manual so you can check before you buy.\\nNow then, let's give it a detailed review:-\\n• Build Design- Live Tech just went full retro on us in Yo! man and we get a controller with looks quite similar to Xbox 360 controller. But no, wait, it gets better. The design is much sleeker at the bottom part which Xbox has a bulge for battery👍🏻. It also has a expandable phone holder, whether you like it or hate it, you can't ignore it. The gamepad works when it is open but as soon as you shut it, so does the pad.\\n•Built Quality- Well here comes a few issues. The quality in general is really good but the triggers don't exude a premium feeling. 🗳️ Don't mistake me here, it's good in comparison with other controllers in the market but not the standard of Xbox 360 (original). The mobile holder thank God is subtle in this series but dents appear if you use it too rigorously.\\n• System Interface/Configuration- No Baby, there aren't any probs to face here. The controller works super smooth and the gaming experience is premium. No late responses, never failed me once. The controls are highly programmable and if you don't like it then change it, it has a function in every game whether pc or mi box/TV. But there might be a tiny issue which you face is that many times in selected games the back button doesn't work, for this go into the settings and rock it into your own style and problem solve.\\n•Battery- Here comes the good part, the company Live Tech does good on their word of maintaining 10 hours of battery life. When the charge is low then the forth led/ LED4 light flashes red rapidly. If the controller is not in use for more than 5 minutes then it switches off, which you can easily reconnect. Very good battery saving optimised, am I right.\\n•Operating System- The previous editions didn't have the pc features buy now you get a whole bunch, so know yourself out. ☺️Yet I believe and this is my own recommendation that you should buy this for Android since it has no probs, loopholes or vetos.... This is hands down the smoothest gamepad, rather, The NO.1 gamepad for AndroidTv/ Box/ Mobiles (don't forget pc, it's compatible).\\nSo what do we conclude?-\\n• Built Design- 5/5 (Déjà vu to Xbox 360)😆\\n• Built Quality- 4/5 (Room for improvement)🤔\\n• User Interface/ configuration-5/5 (Deserves it)😉\\n• Battery- 5/5 (definitely)😏\\n• Operating System- 5/5 (all get that in this department)😂\\nBut as you might have seen in the pictures above I uploaded that I ordered it in Amazon Great Sale. I got the box a little damage ( am saying in moderation😶) by the courier but I excepted on his apology plee. The seller (Live Tech) provides good stuff but be careful not to order in rush hours.😒\\nThis gamepad is phenomenal and dynamic which can be adapted quite easily and the retro look just is love❤️❤️❤️....Live Tech is one of the best upcoming brands in gamepads so people and fans show some love for the brand, its a diamond in the making. I bought this on a whim after I don't know whether you noticed that the gamepads suddenly disappeared from the market for other unknown reasons and this baby here is one of the emerging players of the year. So click the like (helpful) button 👍🏻and go grab a piece of beauty for your TV/ Pc whichever suits you better man. Chao...\\nRead more\",\n",

Two cons on my part is, FM reception is very very poor inspite of attaching the aux of charging cable it finds it very difficult to scan or play in an open land itself. So FM is there for name sake. 2., AV delay when connecting with My Teevision or mobile. There is a minute sec delay when playing audio. Both has bluetooth v5.\\n\\nSo other than that if you are using it for playing audio songs via bluetooth or SD card or USB, it does its work.\\nRead more',\n",

Quite sturdy and compact.\\nAux, voulme up/down, usb charging port\\nSound quality / clarity - deep and very crisp\\nThe sound quality varies it seems when connected via Bluetooth over laptop aux. The video shared is via laptop aux at full volume.\\nIt doesn't disappoint. It's quite the grab for the price. The volume range is wider via Bluetooth. At full volume there is buzz on the bass notes, however it's more than what is expected out of a 5W speaker.\\nI listen to metal, n it handled Lamb of God quite well at moderate volume.\\nCall quality is also clear and the mic clarity is commendable\\nBrought another one and once both the spekaers are paired, its just beast mode. Sound is clear and easily sufficient to fill up a large room.\\nGreat sound quality and it's definitely value for money product\\nRead more\",\n",

It is very light weight & compact in size. It can be easily put in pocket. Overall design is good & build quality is durable.\\n\\nBattery- It comes with Micro USB cable in the box. For charging need to use 5v 0.5watt charger. It takes 2.5 hr to full charge. In single charge it can play music upto 5hrs. So Battery is decent.\\n\\nSound Output- It comes with Dual EQ mode. In normal mode sound output is well balanced not so much loud. I didn't listen any distortion even on Full Volume.\\nDeep Bass mode produce extra bass but I didn't like it so much because vocals & instruments sound distorted at full volume because of extra bass.\\n\\nSomething more you need to know-\\n\\n◆Bluetooth Connectivity is good.\\n◆Mic works good during calls. Call pick & disconnect fuction available by short press of power button.\\n◆Music can be Play/Pause only.\\n◆Rubberised material at bottom for better grip.\\n\\nOverall it is a good & cheapest portable Bluetooth Speaker from the House of Harman.

The speakers come with attached wires, one of which is the jack of 3.5 mm and the other is the power cable which you could either connect to your laptop or PC and can even be connected to a phone with the help of a power bank. The speakers also have a volume controller which makes it so much easier to increase or decrease volume and the best part is you can travel with these mini speakers as it is very convenient to carry them around.

       " \"What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body\\n... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!!\\nYou will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ...\\nI recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ... EAST OR WEST ... SAMSUNG IS THE BEST (expect Samsung M11😂) 😋\\n- Real Fact\",\n",

Supports OTG as well.\\n\\nCons\\n1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.\\n2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉\\n3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.\\n4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.\\n\\nOverall out of 5.Camera-2 Gui-4 Screen ppi-5 speed-4 android-4\\nDon't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\\nRead more\",\n",

       " \"This the best ever non Chinese budget phone you can get at Rs. 10000 to Rs. 12000. I will provide you pros and cons of this Galaxy M11.\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great design, I really like the infinty O display (Punch hole camera design).\\n2. Matte finish, so you can have better hold. (Also it won't shatter like glass, since it has plastic backpanel!).\\n3. One UI - It is a great OS skin apart from Stock android and oxygen OS, and you will not get any annoying ads.\\n4. Massive battery of 5000 mAh - Even with heavy usage, phone's battery can hold for a day, so if you are not a heavy user, you can charge once in two or two and half days. (And slower chip like Snapdragon 465 is additional plus, since it doesn't suck too much battery).\\n5. Since it is a Samsung phone, you will get a minimum SAR Value (Radiation limit) compared to other Chinese brands, so it's good for your health too!\\n6. Fast charging.\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Snapdragon 450, it is obviously slowest chipset in this price range.\\n2. It cannot handle heavy games (Still i could play Call of Duty Mobile without any problem)\\n3. Camera is not that great.\\n4. 720p display, could have given 1080p display.\\n\\nif you play heavy games, then you should be going for Poco M2, which is good in these range.\\n\\nif you are a normal person, who doesn't play much games (I do play games, but not most of the time), you can definitely buy this phone.\\n\\nAnd I say again, it is the best non Chinese phone you can get in this range with amazing design.\\nRead more\",\n",
